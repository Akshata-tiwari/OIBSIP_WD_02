Project Title: Akshata Tiwari – Personal Portfolio Website

Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to develop a responsive and visually engaging personal portfolio website for Akshata Tiwari. It will act as an online resume to represent her background, expertise, and educational projects. It will be aimed at presenting her as a web developer and facilitating a means of contact for potential recruiters or collaborators.

Tools and Technologies Used:
The project is built with standard web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 for styling and structure. Font Awesome is utilized to include social media icons. A code editor like Visual Studio Code was employed for code writing and editing. Image assets have been utilized for project illustrations and profile pictures.

Steps Performed:

A sticky header was designed that contains the website branding and a navigation menu that connects to the About, Skills, Projects, and Contact pages.

The hero section presents Akshata Tiwari with a rounded profile picture, profession, brief description, and a button that connects to the projects page.

The About section provides a concise summary of her education and experience in creating academic projects such as Planly, Mely, and a Weather App.

The Skills section shows a list of technical and soft skills in a clean and responsive layout.

The Projects section showcases three projects:

Mely: A React-built chatbot interface.

Planly: A task management application that employs Firebase as a backend.

Weather App: A weather prediction app based on OpenWeatherMap API.

There is a Contact section with a simple form to gather the user's name, email, and message.

The footer has social media links and copyright notices.
The result is a professional and responsive portfolio website that effectively represents Akshata Tiwari’s skills and work. It provides a clean layout with easy navigation and is ready for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. The website can be easily extended in the future to include features like a downloadable resume, blog section, or interactive elements.

How to Run the Project:
Download or copy the project files. Replace any image URLs that point to the local system (such as C:\Users\.) with images placed in a relative project directory or uploaded online. Finally, open index.html in any web browser to see the website.

Future Enhancements:
In the future, backend support can be implemented for the contact form through Formspree, Firebase, or another service. The site can also be developed into a multi-page portfolio with dedicated project pages, SEO enhancements, and improved accessibility.
